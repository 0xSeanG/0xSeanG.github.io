### Ingredients

* 24 oz frozen corn
* ½ cup red onion, finely chopped
* 1 large poblano pepper, roasted, peeled, seeded, and finely chopped
* 2 jalapeño peppers, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* Salt, to taste

### Directions

1. **Roast the poblano:** Hold pepper with tongs directly over a high gas flame, turning occasionally, until skin is charred and blistered, about 2–3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let steam 10 minutes. Rub off and discard blackened skin. Remove stem and seeds, then finely chop. _(Oven method: broil on a foil-lined baking sheet at 400°F, turning occasionally, 30–40 minutes. Steam and peel as above.)_
2. Cook frozen corn according to package directions. Spread on a baking sheet to cool.
3. In a large bowl, combine cooled corn, red onion, poblano, jalapeños, cilantro, lemon juice, and lime juice. Season to taste with salt.
4. Serve with tortilla chips, or use in burrito bowls and tacos.
