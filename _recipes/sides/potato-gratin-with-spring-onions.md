### Ingredients

* 2½ cups heavy cream
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 cloves garlic, smashed
* Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 bunch spring onions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
* 3 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced ⅛-inch thick
* 2 cups shredded havarti cheese

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter a 9x13 baking dish.
2. Combine cream, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, and nutmeg in a saucepan over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat and let steep 10 minutes. Discard thyme, bay leaves, and garlic.
3. Layer half the potato slices in the baking dish, overlapping slightly. Scatter half the spring onions on top. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining potatoes and spring onions.
4. Pour the infused cream evenly over the potatoes.
5. Cover tightly with foil and bake 45–55 minutes, until potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife.
6. Uncover, sprinkle havarti evenly over the top, and bake an additional 10–15 minutes until cheese is golden and bubbling.
7. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.
