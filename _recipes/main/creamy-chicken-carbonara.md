Note from Chew: "Add Peas!"

### Ingredients

* 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized strips
* 12–14 oz linguine or spaghetti
* 4 strips thick-cut bacon (or pancetta/guanciale), chopped into ½-inch pieces
* 2 cloves garlic, very finely grated
* 1–2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped
* Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste

#### Carbonara Sauce

* 4 eggs (2 whole + 2 yolks only)
* ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese or Pecorino Romano
* Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
* ⅓ cup heavy cream _(optional)_

### Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook linguine al dente. **Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining.**
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and cream (if using). Set aside.
3. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until fully cooked. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Keep 1–2 tbsp bacon grease in the pan; discard the rest.
4. Add chicken strips to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until cooked through, 5–7 minutes. In the last 1–2 minutes, add garlic and a splash of olive oil; cook until fragrant.
5. Turn heat to low and let the pan cool 2–3 minutes. (If pan is too hot, eggs will scramble.)
6. Return bacon to pan. Add warm linguine and the egg mixture along with ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water. Toss until fully coated and creamy. Add more pasta water if sauce is too thick.
7. Top with fresh basil and serve immediately with extra Parmesan.
