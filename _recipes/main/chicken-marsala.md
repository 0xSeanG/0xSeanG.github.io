### Ingredients

* 1¾ cups reduced-sodium chicken broth (14 fl oz)
* 2 tbsp finely chopped shallot
* 5 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
* **20 oz mushrooms, trimmed and thinly sliced** _(doubled)_
* **3 tsp finely chopped fresh sage, divided** _(doubled)_
* ¼ tsp salt
* ⅛ tsp black pepper
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves (2 lbs total)
* 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* **1 cup plus 4 tbsp dry Marsala wine, divided** _(doubled)_
* **1⅓ cups heavy cream** _(doubled)_
* 1 tsp fresh lemon juice

### Directions

1. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F.
2. Bring broth to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan over high heat. Boil uncovered until reduced to about ¾ cup, about 20 minutes.
3. Cook shallot in 3 tbsp butter in an 8- to 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until shallot begins to turn golden, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, 1 tsp sage (half of doubled amount used here), salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid mushrooms give off is evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. Put flour in a wide shallow bowl. Gently pound chicken to ¼-inch thick between 2 sheets of plastic wrap using the flat side of a meat pounder or rolling pin.
5. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour one piece at a time, shaking off excess. Transfer to wax paper in a single layer.
6. Heat 1 tbsp each of oil and butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides. Sauté half the chicken, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a heatproof platter in a single layer and put in oven to keep warm. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining oil, butter, and chicken.
7. Add 1 cup wine to skillet and boil over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, about 30 seconds. Add reduced broth, cream, and mushrooms. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened, 6–8 minutes.
8. Add lemon juice and remaining 4 tbsp wine and ½ tsp sage. Stir to combine.
9. Serve chicken with sauce.
