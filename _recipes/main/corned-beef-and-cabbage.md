### Ingredients

* \~20 boiling onions, peeled
* 2 lbs small red potatoes
* 1 lb carrots
* 3 lb corned beef brisket (with spice packet)
* 1–2 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 tbsp molasses
* 3 tbsp Dijon mustard
* 1 lager beer
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 head cabbage, cut into wedges

### Directions

1. Place peeled boiling onions on the bottom of a large crock pot.
2. Add potatoes and carrots on top of the onions.
3. Place corned beef brisket on top.
4. In a bowl, whisk together garlic, molasses, Dijon mustard, and beer. Pour over brisket.
5. Add bay leaves and the brisket's spice packet.
6. Cook on low all day (8–10 hours).
7. About 1 hour before serving, parboil cabbage wedges in 1–2 inches of water first, then add to the crock pot for the last hour. _(Do not cook cabbage all day — it will make the dish taste like sulphur.)_
