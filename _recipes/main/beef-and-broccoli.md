### Ingredients

#### Beef and Broccoli

* 1 lb flank steak, very thinly sliced into bite-sized strips (against the grain)
* 2 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil, divided
* 1 lb fresh broccoli, cut into florets (\~6 cups)
* 2 tsp sesame seeds, optional garnish

#### Stir Fry Sauce

* 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated (loosely packed)
* 2 tsp garlic, grated (from \~3 cloves)
* ½ cup hot water
* 6 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (or GF tamari)
* 3 tbsp packed light brown sugar
* 1½ tbsp cornstarch
* ¼ tsp black pepper
* 2 tbsp sesame oil

### Directions

1. Start cooking white rice so it's ready when the stir fry is done.
2. Freeze steak 30 minutes for easier slicing, then slice very thinly against the grain into bite-sized strips.
3. Whisk all sauce ingredients together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat with 1 tbsp oil. Add broccoli florets and sauté 4–5 minutes, partially covered, stirring several times, until bright green and crisp-tender. _(Add 2 tbsp water before covering if you prefer softer broccoli.)_ Remove broccoli from pan.
5. Increase heat to high and add remaining 1 tbsp oil. Add beef in a single layer and sauté 2 minutes per side, just until cooked through. Do not overcrowd the pan.
6. Pour in the sauce, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 3–4 minutes until thickened.
7. Return broccoli to the pan and stir to combine. Add 1–2 tbsp water to thin the sauce if desired.
8. Serve over white rice, garnished with sesame seeds.
