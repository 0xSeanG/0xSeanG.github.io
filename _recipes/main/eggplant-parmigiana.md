Temp: 375°F | Bake: 35–40 min

### Ingredients

* 2 large eggplants, sliced into ½-inch rounds
* Salt, for sweating eggplant
* 2 cups marinara sauce (homemade or store-bought)
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging
* 3 large eggs, beaten
* 2 cups Italian-style breadcrumbs
* Olive oil, for frying
* Fresh basil leaves, optional garnish

### Directions

1. Sprinkle eggplant slices generously with salt on both sides. Let sit 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
2. Set up a breading station: flour on one plate, beaten eggs in a bowl, breadcrumbs on a second plate.
3. Dredge each eggplant slice in flour, dip in egg, then coat with breadcrumbs.
4. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry eggplant slices in batches until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
5. Preheat oven to 375°F.
6. Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Layer fried eggplant slices, more sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with cheese on top.
7. Cover with foil and bake 25 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10–15 minutes until bubbly and golden.
8. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil if desired.
