### Ingredients

* 1½ lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 1 tbsp olive oil (for seasoning chicken)
* 1 tbsp olive oil + 2 tbsp salted butter, divided (for cooking)
* 1–2 tsp each: garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika
* 2 carrots, peeled and diced
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 cup orzo pasta
* 1 heaping tbsp chicken bouillon powder + 2½ cups water (OR 2 cups chicken broth)
* 2 cups broccoli florets, chopped
* ½ cup heavy cream
* 2 cups freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Directions

1. Toss chicken with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.
2. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until browned and cooked through, about 6–8 minutes. Remove and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, melt remaining 1 tbsp butter. Add carrots and onion; season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook about 7 minutes until softened. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute more.
4. Stir in orzo and toast for 1 minute. Add bouillon and water (or broth), scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in broccoli.
5. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer 11–12 minutes until orzo is tender and most liquid is absorbed.
6. Stir in heavy cream, cheddar, and Parmesan until fully melted and creamy.
7. Return chicken to the skillet, stir to combine, and serve hot.
