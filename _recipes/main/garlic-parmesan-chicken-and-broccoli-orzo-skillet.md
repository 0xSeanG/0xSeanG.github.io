### Ingredients

* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, diced
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tsp Italian seasoning
* Salt and black pepper, to taste
* 1½ cups uncooked orzo pasta
* 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 cups broccoli florets (fresh or frozen)
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* ½ cup heavy cream
* 1 tbsp butter
* Fresh parsley or basil, chopped (for garnish)

### Directions

1. Heat olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add diced chicken and season with salt, pepper, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Sauté until golden and cooked through, about 6–8 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, melt butter. Add orzo and stir frequently for 2 minutes until slightly toasted.
4. Pour in chicken broth and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook uncovered 8–10 minutes, stirring often, until orzo is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed.
5. Stir in broccoli and cooked chicken. Cover and cook 3–4 more minutes until broccoli is bright and tender.
6. Add heavy cream and Parmesan. Stir until creamy and smooth.
7. Adjust seasoning if needed. Garnish with parsley or basil and serve hot.
