### Ingredients

* 1 (4–5 lb) chuck roast
* 2 tbsp kosher salt
* 1 tbsp paprika
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tbsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp onion powder
* 1–2 tbsp ground coffee (fresh or leftover)
* 2 tbsp beef tallow or butter
* 1 large yellow onion, sliced
* 8 oz shiitake mushrooms, sliced
* 6–8 whole garlic cloves, peeled
* 1 cup red wine (optional but encouraged)
* 3–4 cups broth (beef, chicken, or vegetable), enough to come halfway up the roast
* 2 sprigs rosemary
* 2 sprigs thyme
* 1 sprig marjoram
* 2 leaves sage
* 1 tbsp butter, for finishing (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 300°F. Rub chuck roast generously with salt, paprika, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and ground coffee. Let rest while oven preheats.
2. Heat a heavy Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add tallow or butter, then sear roast on all sides until deeply browned. Don't rush — color equals flavor. Remove roast and set aside.
3. In the same pot, add a touch more fat. Add onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Sauté until caramelized, scraping up all browned bits from the bottom.
4. Pour in red wine to deglaze, stirring as it bubbles and reduces by about half.
5. Nestle the roast back into the pot. Pour in enough broth to come halfway up the meat. Add rosemary, thyme, marjoram, and sage.
6. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover and transfer to the oven. Cook 3–4 hours, until beef is tender enough to shred with a fork.
7. Remove meat. Whisk butter into the remaining liquid to make a glossy sauce. Pour over beef or serve on the side.
