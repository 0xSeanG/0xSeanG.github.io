### Ingredients

#### Chicken & Sandwich

* 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally into thin cutlets
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 6 slices thick-cut bacon
* 1 medium yellow onion, sliced
* 2 medium poblano peppers, sliced into strips
* 4 slices sourdough bread
* 2 tbsp garlic butter (or softened butter + garlic powder)
* Optional: 4 slices pepper-jack or provolone cheese

#### Dry Rub

* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* ½ tsp black pepper
* ½ tsp brown sugar
* ¼ tsp ground cumin
* ¼ tsp chili powder

#### Creamy Sauce

* ½ cup mayonnaise
* 1 tbsp hot sauce (Cholula or Frank's)
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar

### Directions

1. **Prep chicken:** Pat cutlets dry. Mix dry rub ingredients. Drizzle cutlets with olive oil and coat with rub. Let rest 10–15 minutes.
2. **Cook bacon:** Preheat griddle to medium-high. Cook bacon 6–8 minutes, flipping once, until crispy. Move to a cooler zone.
3. **Char vegetables:** Cook onion and poblano strips in bacon fat for 5–7 minutes until softened and charred. Season lightly.
4. **Cook chicken:** Cook cutlets 3–4 minutes per side until golden and internal temp reaches 165°F. Add cheese in the final 30 seconds if using.
5. **Toast bread:** Spread garlic butter on sourdough and toast butter-side down 1–2 minutes until golden.
6. **Make sauce:** Whisk all sauce ingredients until smooth. Adjust to taste.
7. **Assemble:** Spread sauce on bottom slice of bread. Layer chicken, veggies, bacon, more sauce, then top slice. Slice and serve.
