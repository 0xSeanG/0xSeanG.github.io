### Notes

* **My modifications:** Use Golden Delicious apples (\~5); try half Granny Smith next time. Slice thicker than ¼ inch. Reduce bake time by 5–10 min. Use tinfoil wrap instead of pie shield.

### Ingredients

* 2 (9-inch) pie crusts (store-bought or homemade)
* 7 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced ¼-inch thick _(see notes above)_
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup packed brown sugar
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* ⅛ tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* 1 egg + 1 tbsp water (egg wash)
* Sanding sugar, for topping

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Peel, core, and slice apples. Toss with granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Set aside.
3. Fit one pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish. Fill with the apple mixture, mounding slightly in the center.
4. Top with the second crust. Trim edges, fold under, and crimp. Cut several slits in the top crust to vent.
5. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar.
6. Cover edges with a pie shield or tinfoil to prevent over-browning.
7. Bake at 400°F for 25 minutes, then reduce heat to 375°F and bake for 30–35 minutes more, until crust is golden and filling is bubbling. _(Reduce total bake time 5–10 min if using Golden Delicious.)_
8. Cool on a wire rack at least 2 hours before slicing.
