### Ingredients

* 2 lbs finely ground pork fat
* 2 lbs finely ground pork
* 2 onions, finely chopped
* 4 cups water
* 1 tsp ground cloves
* ¾ tsp ground nutmeg
* Salt and ground black pepper, to taste
* Adobo seasoning, to taste _(personal addition)_

### Directions

1. Combine pork fat, ground pork, onions, water, cloves, and nutmeg in a large pot. Season with salt, pepper, and adobo. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer at least 1½ hours, mashing the mixture with a potato masher every 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep from boiling dry. _(The longer it simmers, the better the flavor.)_
3. When ready to stop cooking, reduce remaining liquid as much as possible without letting it burn. Transfer to lidded containers.
4. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Remove and discard the fat layer on top, or stir it back in for a creamier spread.

**Serve on toast or crackers.**
