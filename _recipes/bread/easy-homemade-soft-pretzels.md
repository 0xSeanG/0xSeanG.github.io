Source: [https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-homemade-soft-pretzels/](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-homemade-soft-pretzels/) | Yield: 12 pretzels | Prep: 25 min | Cook: 15 min | Total: 40 min

### Ingredients

**Dough**

* 2¼ tsp (7g) instant or active dry yeast (1 standard packet)
* 1 tbsp brown sugar or granulated sugar
* 1½ cups (360ml) warm water (around 100°F/38°C)
* 1 tbsp (14g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
* 1 tsp salt
* 3¾–4 cups (469–500g) all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
* Coarse salt, for topping

**Baking Soda Bath**

* ½ cup (120g) baking soda
* 9 cups (2.13L) water

### Directions

1. Whisk the yeast and sugar into the warm water. Cover and let sit for 1 minute.
2. Whisk in melted butter and salt. Add 3 cups (375g) of flour and mix with a wooden spoon or dough hook until combined. Add ¾ cup (94g) more flour until dough is slightly tacky and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If still sticky, add up to ¼ cup (31g) more flour, 1 tbsp at a time. Poke the dough — if it bounces back, it is ready to knead.
3. Knead in the mixer for 3–5 minutes, or by hand on a lightly floured surface for 3–5 minutes. Dough should feel soft and slightly tacky. Do not add more flour than needed. After kneading, poke the dough — if it slowly bounces back, it's ready to rise.
4. Shape dough into a ball, cover lightly with a towel, and let rest for 10–30 minutes.
5. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper (lightly greased if using parchment).
6. Cut dough into 75g sections (about ⅓ cup each).
7. Roll each section into a 20–22-inch rope. Form a circle, twist the ends together at the top, then bring the twisted ends down toward you and press to form a pretzel shape.
8. Bring baking soda and 9 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Drop 1–2 pretzels into the boiling water for 20–30 seconds — no longer or they'll have a metallic taste. Lift out with a slotted spatula, let excess water drip off, and place on prepared baking sheets.
9. Sprinkle tops with coarse salt. Bake 12–15 minutes, until dark golden brown.
10. Store leftovers covered at room temperature for up to 3 days. To reheat: microwave a few seconds, or bake at 350°F for 5 minutes.

### Notes

* **Make ahead (baked):** Freeze unsalted baked pretzels for up to 3 months. To reheat from frozen, brush with water, sprinkle with salt, bake at 350°F for 20 minutes.
* **Make ahead (dough):** Refrigerate dough up to 1 day or freeze up to 2–3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge. Shape cold; allow ~1 hour to puff at room temp before boiling and baking.
* **Make ahead (boiled, unbaked):** After boiling, freeze on a baking sheet for 1 hour, then transfer to freezer bag for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen at 400°F for 15–20 minutes.
* **Skip the baking soda bath?** Brush shaped pretzels with egg wash (1 egg + 1 tbsp milk) instead — the baking soda bath is strongly recommended for authentic flavor and texture.
* **Cinnamon sugar variation:** Skip the coarse salt. Bake as directed. Brush warm baked pretzels with melted butter, then dip in a mix of ¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar + 1½ tsp cinnamon. Best eaten same day.
* **Bread flour** can be substituted 1:1 for even chewier pretzels.
