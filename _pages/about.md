This is the Goodwin Family Cookbook — a collection of our favorite recipes gathered over the years.

These are the dishes we make for holidays, weeknight dinners, potlucks, and everything in between. Some are family originals, some are trusted finds from around the web, and all of them have earned a permanent spot in our rotation.

The cookbook is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
